# Milestone-1-Word-Game

1) Inspiration for a word game
    I wanted to do a word game becasue I play a lot of them and have for a long time. I first thought of creating a crossword game but that seems more complicated and possibly beyond my skill set. I then started looking into building a word guess game and started thinking about a game that has become popular recently called Wordle. Wordle has a simple layout and since I am not a designer, I could use CSS and make it look how I'd like without a lot of art skills. The words are generated randomly so writing code to generate them would be needed. The HTML document would need columns and rows(potentially) and would not be overly complex allowing me to focus on the JavaScript portion.

2) How to play. 
    With Wordle you have a six chances to guess a pre-chosen five letter word. As you play the code gives you hints when you have the correct letters and more hints if you have the letter(s) in the correct spot in the word.

3) Technologies I could use:
    - HTML
    - CSS: flex box, colors, fonts 
    - JavaScript: arrays, math.random, event.listeners, if/else statements, for loops, API(word generators and/dictionaries)
