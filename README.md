# Milestone-1-Word-Game

1) Inspiration for a word game
    I wanted to do a word game becasue I play a lot of them and have for a long time. I first thought of creating a crossword game but that seems more complicated and possibly beyond my skill set. I then started looking into building a word guess game and started thinking about a game that has become popular recently called Wordle. Wordle has a simple layout and since I am not a designer, I could use CSS and make it look how I'd like without a lot of art skills. The words are generated randomly so writing code to generate them would be needed. The HTML document would need columns and rows(potentially) and would not be overly complex allowing me to focus on the JavaScript portion.

2) How to play. 
    My version requires the keyboard for inputting letters into the tiles on the screen. After entering a word on a line , hit enter and it will reveal how many correct letters and in what postion they may be for the next guess. Keep guessing until the correct answer is revealed in ALL green letter tiles or the solution appears above the board. If the soultion appears above the board, you didn't figure out the solution.

    
3) Technologies I could use:
    - HTML
    - CSS: flex box, colors, fonts 
    - JavaScript: arrays, event.listeners, if/else statements, for loops, API(word generators and/dictionaries)
